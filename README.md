# mcp-server-appstoreconnect

A production-ready [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that connects Claude Code (or any MCP host) to your **TestFlight beta feedback** in App Store Connect — so tester feedback flows straight into an AI-assisted workflow: *fetch → analyze screenshots → prioritize → generate TODOs → file issues → fix the code* without leaving the IDE.

Built on [krishnal/mcp-server-boilerplate](https://github.com/krishnal/mcp-server-boilerplate): transport-agnostic MCP core (spec `2025-06-18`), stdio/HTTP/Lambda adapters, Zod-validated config, Pino/Prometheus/OTel observability, pluggable auth.

- **Upstream API**: the official, stable **App Store Connect API 4.0** beta-feedback endpoints (`betaFeedbackScreenshotSubmissions`, `betaFeedbackCrashSubmissions`, crash logs) — no private/undocumented APIs
- **Local state**: SQLite via Node's built-in `node:sqlite` — zero native dependencies, works everywhere including Lambda bundles
- **AI analysis**: dual-mode — the MCP host model (Claude) analyzes screenshots by default with **zero extra configuration**, or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and the server analyzes autonomously
- **Integrations**: file issues into GitHub, Jira, or Linear with full context, idempotently

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_apps` | Resolve App Store Connect app ids (feeds `ASC_APP_ID`) |
| `list_feedback` | List screenshot/crash feedback with filters (build, version, device, OS, platform, date range, processed state) |
| `get_feedback` | Full detail: comment, device/build context, screenshots, analysis, TODO, linked issues, processed state |
| `get_crash_log` | Crash log text for a crash submission |
| `download_screenshot` | Download screenshots to `./screenshots/<id>/` (signed URLs expire — expiry is handled) and embed them for immediate visual analysis |
| `list_unprocessed` | The triage queue — everything not yet marked processed |
| `mark_processed` / `mark_unprocessed` | Local processed state, with an optional resolution note |
| `analyze_feedback` | Structured analysis (screen, problem, component, severity, confidence, fix approach) — autonomous with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, otherwise hands evidence to the host model |
| `save_analysis` | Persist a host-performed analysis (the other half of the dual mode) |
| `generate_todo` | Actionable engineering checklist (reproduce → root-cause → fix → test → verify → close) |
| `group_duplicates` | Cluster similar feedback (lexical similarity + build/device/screen signals) |
| `prioritize_feedback` | Rank by severity × duplicate frequency × recency, with human-readable reasons |
| `create_issue` | File a GitHub/Jira/Linear issue with comment, context, analysis, TODO, screenshot paths — idempotent per feedback+provider |

Plus a `feedback://{id}` **resource template** (attach feedback to conversations) and a `triage_feedback` **prompt** (guided end-to-end triage workflow).

## Quickstart

Requires **Node.js ≥ 24** (`nvm use` picks up `.nvmrc`; `node:sqlite` ships with Node 24).

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env    # fill in the ASC_* credentials (below)

npm run dev:stdio       # stdio transport (for MCP hosts) — or `npm run dev` for HTTP
npm test                # 107 tests
```

### Credentials (App Store Connect API key)

1. App Store Connect → **Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API → Team Keys → “+”**.
2. Role: **Developer** (or App Manager). Beta-feedback endpoints require Admin, App Manager, or Developer.
3. Note the **Issuer ID** (top of the page) and the key's **Key ID**, and download the **`.p8` file** — Apple lets you download it exactly once.

```bash
# .env
ASC_ISSUER_ID=69a6de70-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
ASC_KEY_ID=ABC123DEFG
ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=./AuthKey_ABC123DEFG.p8      # or:
# ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64=$(base64 -i AuthKey_ABC123DEFG.p8)
ASC_APP_ID=1234567890                              # optional; find via list_apps
```

**Key handling:** the `.p8` is read lazily, never logged (Pino redaction covers key material), and never leaves the process — screenshots are downloaded from Apple's pre-signed CDN URLs *without* attaching your bearer token. `*.p8`, `data/`, and `screenshots/` are gitignored. JWTs are ES256, minted for 15 minutes (Apple's cap is 20), cached, refreshed proactively, and re-minted once on a 401.

The server boots **without** credentials too: local-state tools keep working and ASC-backed tools return instructions instead of failing cryptically.

### Claude Code

```bash
npm run build
claude mcp add testflight -- node /absolute/path/to/mcp-server-appstoreconnect/dist/server.js --stdio
```

No env flags needed: at startup the server loads the `.env` sitting in **its own project root** (never the spawn directory — MCP hosts launch servers from arbitrary cwds). Real environment variables always override the file, so `--env` flags or a `claude_desktop_config.json` `"env"` block still win when you want per-host overrides.

Because the spawn cwd is arbitrary, keep `STATE_DB_PATH` and `SCREENSHOTS_DIR` **absolute** in `.env` (the defaults are relative and would resolve against whatever project Claude Code is running in).

In stdio mode all logs go to stderr; stdout is reserved for the protocol.

## Example Claude workflows

**Morning triage** (or just invoke the `triage_feedback` prompt):

> *"Check my TestFlight feedback. Group duplicates, prioritize what's pending, then walk me through the top 3 with screenshots."*

Claude calls `list_unprocessed` → `group_duplicates` → `prioritize_feedback`, then `analyze_feedback` per item — the screenshots come back as images Claude inspects directly, persisting its findings via `save_analysis`.

**From feedback to fix:**

> *"Analyze feedback fb-123, find the code responsible and fix it."*

`analyze_feedback` returns the screenshot + device context; Claude identifies the affected screen/component, greps your codebase, makes the change, then `generate_todo` tracks the verification steps and `mark_processed` closes the loop.

**From feedback to ticket:**

> *"File the checkout-overlap feedback as a GitHub issue and mark it processed with the issue number."*

`create_issue` bundles the comment, build/device context, analysis, TODO checklist, and screenshot paths — and it's idempotent, so retries return the existing issue instead of filing duplicates.

**Crash triage:**

> *"Any new crashes this week? Pull the crash logs and tell me what's crashing."*

`list_feedback (kind: crash, since: ...)` → `get_crash_log` → Claude reads the stack.

## Architecture

```
src/
├── asc/               # App Store Connect: ES256 token provider, typed API client
├── storage/           # node:sqlite FeedbackStore (cache, state, idempotency)
├── analysis/          # analyzer (Claude vision), similarity, prioritize, todo
├── issues/            # IssueProvider interface + github/jira/linear
├── services/          # composition of the above, injected as ctx.services
├── capabilities/      # MCP tools/resources/prompts (thin: parse → services → format)
├── core/              # boilerplate protocol engine (dispatcher, registry, sessions)
├── adapters/          # stdio.ts · http.ts · lambda.ts
└── config/            # Zod-validated env config
```

Layering: capabilities never speak HTTP or SQL; `asc/` never touches SQLite; `analysis/` and `issues/` depend only on domain types. Everything reaches handlers through one typed `ctx.services` bag built in the composition root — tests inject fakes there (see `tests/helpers/fixtures.ts`).

**Reliability & error handling:** App Store Connect 429s are retried honoring `Retry-After`; 401s trigger one token refresh+retry; expired screenshot URLs are re-fetched automatically; every upstream failure surfaces as an `isError` tool result with Apple's actual error detail so the calling LLM can self-correct. Handlers honor the request's `AbortSignal` (client cancellation and server timeouts).

**Idempotency:** `mark_processed`/`save_analysis`/`generate_todo` are upserts; `create_issue` files at most one issue per (feedback, provider) and returns the existing link on retries; re-listing feedback refreshes the cache without clobbering local state.

### The dual-mode AI analysis

Apple gives you the screenshot; someone needs vision to read it. Two ways, same stored result:

- **Host-delegated (default, zero config):** `analyze_feedback` returns the screenshot(s) as MCP image blocks + device context + instructions; the host model (Claude) analyzes and persists via `save_analysis`. Your API bill: nothing extra.
- **Autonomous (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set):** the server calls Claude (`claude-opus-4-8` by default) with vision + structured outputs and stores the validated analysis itself. Useful for headless/batch use.

Downstream tools (`prioritize_feedback`, `generate_todo`, `create_issue`) read the same schema either way (`src/analysis/schema.ts`).

## Deployment

### Local (stdio) — recommended for Claude Code/Desktop

```bash
npm run build && npm run start:stdio
```

### Docker (HTTP)

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t mcp-server-appstoreconnect .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ASC_ISSUER_ID=... -e ASC_KEY_ID=... -e ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64="$(base64 -i AuthKey.p8)" \
  -e ASC_APP_ID=... -e HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e AUTH_MODE=api-key -e API_KEYS=your-key:* \
  -v testflight-data:/app/data -v testflight-shots:/app/screenshots \
  mcp-server-appstoreconnect
```

Mount volumes for `/app/data` and `/app/screenshots` so state survives restarts. Health checks: `/healthz` (liveness), `/readyz` (readiness); Prometheus metrics on `/metrics`.

### AWS Lambda

```bash
sam build && sam deploy --guided      # template.yaml (nodejs24.x, arm64)
# or: npm run build:lambda → dist/lambda/index.mjs, deploy with any tool
```

Use `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` (no filesystem needed) and set `STATE_DB_PATH=/tmp/testflight.db`, `SCREENSHOTS_DIR=/tmp/screenshots`. Because `node:sqlite` is built into the runtime, the single-file bundle just works — **but `/tmp` is per-container and ephemeral**, so processed flags and analyses reset between cold starts. For durable state on Lambda, mount EFS for the DB path; for the full feature set (sessions, subscriptions, persistent state) prefer the container deployment. Lambda runs stateless (ephemeral sessions, no server-push).

## Extending

**A new tool** (the boilerplate pattern still applies — schema + handler, register, done):

```ts
// src/capabilities/tools/my-tool.ts
export const myTool = defineTool({
  name: 'my_tool',
  description: '...',
  inputSchema: z.object({ feedbackId: z.string() }),
  handler: async ({ feedbackId }, ctx) => {
    const stored = ctx.services.store.getFeedback(feedbackId); // full services bag
    return { content: [{ type: 'text', text: '...' }] };
  },
});
// then registry.registerTool(myTool) in src/capabilities/index.ts
```

**A new issue provider:** implement the 1-method `IssueProvider` interface (`src/issues/types.ts`), add a config block in `src/config/index.ts`, register it in `createIssueProviders` (`src/issues/index.ts`). Idempotency comes for free from the `issues` table.

**Smarter duplicate detection:** swap the lexical scorer in `src/analysis/similarity.ts` for embeddings — `clusterFeedback`'s contract (items in, groups out) doesn't change.

**Polling / notifications:** the boilerplate supports subscribable resources — poll `listFeedback` on an interval from your business logic and call `appContext.notifyResourceUpdated(...)` to push `notifications/resources/updated` to subscribed clients (HTTP transport).

**Different storage:** `FeedbackStore` (`src/storage/feedback-store.ts`) is the entire storage surface — reimplement it over Postgres/DynamoDB/libsql and swap it in `createServices`.

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # 107 tests: unit + protocol-level + transport integration
npm run coverage
npm run typecheck
```

Capability tests drive the **real dispatcher** through `tests/helpers/mcp-test-client.ts` with fake ASC/issue services injected via the composition root (`tests/helpers/fixtures.ts`) — every tool is spec-tested without network. The ASC client and issue providers are tested against `undici` `MockAgent` upstreams (pagination, 401 refresh, 429 retry, error mapping). Token minting is tested with real ES256 keys and a fake clock.

## Configuration reference

See **`.env.example`** for the full annotated list. Highlights:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ASC_ISSUER_ID` / `ASC_KEY_ID` | — | App Store Connect API key identity |
| `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` \| `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` | — | the `.p8` key (exactly one) |
| `ASC_APP_ID` | — | default app for feedback tools |
| `STATE_DB_PATH` | `./data/testflight.db` | SQLite state (`:memory:` ok; `/tmp/...` on Lambda) |
| `SCREENSHOTS_DIR` | `./screenshots` | downloaded screenshot storage |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | enables autonomous analysis (optional) |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | `claude-opus-4-8` | model for autonomous analysis |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`+`GITHUB_REPO`, `JIRA_*`, `LINEAR_*` | — | issue providers (any subset) |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | `http` | `http` or `stdio` (CLI `--stdio` overrides) |
| `AUTH_MODE` | `none` | `none` \| `api-key` \| `jwt` (HTTP edge) |

Partial provider/credential configuration fails at boot with a readable error — absence degrades gracefully, misconfiguration never does.
